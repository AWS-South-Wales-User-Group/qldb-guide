To get started, click one of the links to the [QLDB Demo](https://qldbdemo.com). This will take you to a hosted page where you can sign in if you already have credentials, else create an account:

When you create an account, you must specify a `username`, `password`, `email address` and `phone number`. The `email address` must be a valid email address that you have access too. No use is made of phone number so any values can be entered here.

After you click on the `Create Account` button, you will be presented with a screen to confirm the sign-up process. Here you will need to enter a verification code:

The verification will automatically be sent to the email address you used to register with:
